# LeagueMatchAccept
HEY!! It's my first project, so don't expect much.
The code is in Python, uses Tkinter for the UI, and the .exe was created with PyInstaller.

It's a program for League of Legends. It auto-accepts matches and can ban or pick from a custom pool of champions.
It will most likely get flagged as a virus, but it isn't ‚Äî that's also why I'm uploading the full project, so you can check it yourself.

This was originally created as a project for me and my friends, and I used ChatGPT for help.
You can now do whatever you want with the code and files.

If you just want to run the program, here‚Äôs the download link:

since it uses PyInstaller it get's false positive for threat detection on windows.
