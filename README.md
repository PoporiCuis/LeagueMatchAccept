# LeagueMatchAutoAccept
HEY!! It's my first project, so don't expect much.
The code is in Python, uses Tkinter for the UI, and the .exe was created with PyInstaller.

It's a program for League of Legends. It auto-accepts matches and can ban or pick from a custom pool of champions.
It will most likely get flagged as a virus, but it isn't ‚Äî that's also why I'm uploading the full project, so you can check it yourself.
It just uses the LoLClientAPI and Riot's Data Dragon. 

This was originally created as a project for me and my friends, and I used ChatGPT for help.
You can now do whatever you want with the code and files.

If you just want to run the program, here‚Äôs the download link:

since it uses PyInstaller it get's false positive for threat detection on windows.
This won't get you baned since it just uses League'sAPI and it also does nothing during a match.
